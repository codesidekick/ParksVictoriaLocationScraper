Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

Currently on [Parks Victoria](http://parkweb.vic.gov.au) it's impossible to get GPS coordinates for the national parks and camping areas. This makes it difficult to get directions using Google Maps as often Google Maps doesn't find campsites or doesn't place them correctly on the map.
